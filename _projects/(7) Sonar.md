description: We took lyrics from 30 years of the Sònar festival and fed it to GPT-4, a popular large language model that is capable of producing realistic conversations. Then we visualized the patterns that GPT-4 found in these data and crossed them with artists and years of presentation , in order to reveal the patterns in the works that were presented at Sònar and particularly the evolution over time. We thus cracked open the black box of AI to get a better understanding how it captures patterns and trends in song lyrics. We showed how AI works from within.
