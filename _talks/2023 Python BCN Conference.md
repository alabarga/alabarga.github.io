description: In the era of digital transformation, the concept of “Digital Twins” has emerged as a powerful tool for simulating, predicting, and optimizing real-world systems. At the heart of these digital replicas lies data, and often, the challenge is to have enough high-quality data to train robust AI models. This is where synthetic data generation comes into play. In this workshop, participants will be introduced to the world of synthetic data generation and its pivotal role in enabling AI-based digital twins. We will delve into the challenges of real-world data, the need for synthetic data, and the methodologies to generate it using Python
